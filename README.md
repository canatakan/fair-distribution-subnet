# A Tool for Deployment and Management of Avalanche Blockchain Subnets with Policy Based Faucets

## Overview

This project provides an easy interface to deploy your own Avalanche blockchain subnet with a policy based faucet. The policy based faucets allow you to specify a policy for the distribution of resources to the users of the subnet. The policy itself can be specified in the front-end directly. It is then compiled into a smart contract and deployed to the newly created subnet.
